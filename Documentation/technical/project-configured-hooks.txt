Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Context
^^^^^^^

Git has linkgit:githooks[hooks] functionality to allow users to
execute commands or scripts when certain Git events occur. Some use cases
include:

* The `pre-commit` hook event:

  ** A developer may want to lint their changes to enforce certain code style
  and quality. The project may want the commit to fail so that commits that
  violate the project's style don't get uploaded.

  ** The project may want to prevent developers from committing passwords or
  other sensitive information e.g. via
  https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[git-secrets].

* The `commit-msg` hook event: the project may want to enforce a certain commit
message style. This may be out of necessity:
https://www.gerritcodereview.com/[Gerrit Code Review], for example, requires
each commit to have a Change-Id in the footer.

* The `pre-push` hook: the project may want to verify that pushes are going to
the correct central repository to prevent leaks.

A common thread between these use cases is to enforce certain behavior across
many developers working in the same code base, encouraging best practices and
healthy code quality.

Hooks today are configured individually in each clone, making it difficult for
project maintainers to enforce hooks usage across them.
https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210311021037.3001235-2-emilyshaffer@google.com[Configuration-based
hook management], by moving hooks to the config, makes this easier; individuals
can at least configure hooks to be used across multiple workspaces on their
host.

However, there is still no good way for project maintainers to encourage or
enforce adoption of specific hook commands on specific hook events in a clone.
As such, there are many tools that provide this functionality on top of Git (see
<<prior-art, Prior Art>>) with a lot of adoption across projects big and small:

  * According to it's GitHub page, Husky has 22M million monthly downloads and is
used by 437K projects.

  * Example open source projects that depend on this type of behavior include
  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/repohooks/[the Android Open
  Source Project], {chrome-os}[ChromeOS],
  https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/.husky[Angular], and
  https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/.husky[Webpack].

The wide adoption of solutions combined with the fragmentation in solution
adoption speaks to the opportunity for the Git project to provide a standard
solution to Git users. In doing so, we can provide a secure, well-supported,
well-maintained, and better functioning solution (e.g. does not require extra
dependencies) that benefits all Git users.

We propose adding native Git functionality to allow project maintainers to
specify hooks that a user ought to install and utilize in their development
workflows.

Server-side vs Local Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A large motivation for this change is providing projects a method to enable
local checks of code e.g. linting. As documented in
linkgit:gitfaq#_hooks[gitfaq], in some cases, server-side
checks may be more appropriate, especially since developers can always skip
local hook execution. We think there are still benefits to local checks:

* Ensuring commit message style and preventing the committing of sensitive data,
as described above. In particular, if CI results are public, as with many open
source projects, server side checks are useless for guarding against leaking
sensitive data.

* Helps developers catch issues earlier: typically developers need to push to
the remote to trigger server-side checks. Local hooks can be run anytime the
developer wants. This is especially useful if the project has slow
server-checks; catching issues locally can save the developer a lot of time
waiting for CI. They are also useful for locally reproducing an issue identified
in CI, helping resolve issues faster.

* Since the typical goal of developers to submit changes to a central
repository, their interests are aligned with the project maintainers'; while
they can choose to skip local hook execution, it is in their interest to allow
hooks to run at least before proposing code for submission to the central
repository to increase the chances of the code getting accepted.

In the ideal world, developers and project maintainers use both local and
server-side checks in their workflow. However, for many smaller projects, this
may not be possible: server-side checks may be too expensive, either monetarily
or in terms of time investment, to run. The number of local solutions to this
use case speaks to this need (see <<prior-art, Prior Art>>). Bringing this
natively to Git can give all these developers a well-supported, secure
implementation opposed to the fragmentation we see today.

User Goals / Critical User Journeys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* As a project maintainer,

    ** I want to enforce code style so I require developers to use a
    standardized linter.

    ** I want to prevent sensitive data from getting checked in.

    ** I want to prevent leaks so I check that developers are uploading code to
    the right private central repository. Conversely, I may want to encourage
    more open source development and encourage developers to push to public
    central repositories.

    ** I want this to just work for all the developers in my project, without
    needing to support them through configuration.

* As a developer developing in a local clone,

    ** I want to set up my workspace.

    ** I want control over what code runs on my machine.

    ** I want to set up my own hooks, in addition to or in lieu of project
    configured hooks.

    ** I want to skip hooks from running (for various reasons).

Security Threat Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

==== Principles

1. It is unreasonable to require users to audit hook code themselves.

    * Users do not have time
    * Users, in general, are unfamiliar with system exploits / security
    * Users may be unfamiliar with a hook’s implementation language
    * Hooks may be compiled binaries and unauditable

2. It is reasonable for users to make a trust decision based on where a hook comes from.

    * Society functions on the basis of trust relationships formed between different
    agents --- this is the basis for being able to accomplish more than one person
    can personally accomplish. The complexity is giving users the power to make that
    trust decision.
    * Git users are already making trust decisions based on repository origin.

==== Happy Path

* User clones repository

    ** Clone occurs over a secure transport (HTTPS / SSH)

* After clone, repository suggests hooks to the user

    ** User receives a non-interactive message advertising hooks available to
    install

    ** User can see what hooks and commands are being suggested and from what
    remote.

* User evaluates the hook's purpose and publisher and decides whether to install
it

    ** Installation happens through a separate command the user runs, not an
    interactive prompt.

* [Minimum Feature] A repository owner can update a hook, at which point users who have
installed it can decide whether to upgrade or uninstall it

    ** This avoids having to define in the first round of this feature whether
    the hook's purpose and publisher have changed little enough to reuse the
    user's previous consent.

    ** A good enhancement soon after would be to allow users to indicate at hook
    installation time that they want to accept all updates of this same hook
    from the same origin.

==== In-Scope Threats

1. Repository owner changes hooks frequently to coax user into accidentally or
mindlessly agreeing to install malicious hooks (“please make this prompt go
away,” “why are you bothering me?”). Mitigation:

    ** Never interactively prompt for hook installation

    ** Advertise hooks up front instead of waiting until hooks are about to
    execute. Up front, the user's intent is to set up their workspace so the
    install message is relevant to them; when the user is in the middle of
    another action, they are more likely to blindly agree.

    ** Give users an easy way to disable all advertisements for hooks

2. Adversary intercepts requests for a repository and inserts malicious hooks
(person-in-the-middle-type attacks). Mitigation:

    ** Only receive hooks suggestions over HTTPS / SSH

    ** Include the hook origin (domain name) in the command to install a hook

3. Malicious repository owner convinces user, who does not intend to run any
other git commands in the repository after clone, to install hooks. Mitigation:

    ** Do not automatically install hooks on a normal `git clone`

    ** Do not interactively prompt to install hooks after the clone is finished.

4. Adversary exploits an old security issue with a hook that has since been
patched. Mitigation:

    ** Allow users to opt-into hooks getting auto-updated

==== Out-of-Scope Threats

1. Repository owner convinces a user who already intends to build code in the
repository to knowingly and explicitly agree to install hooks. Justification:

    ** This is equivalent (in terms of attack surface) to setting up your
    dependencies / building the source code, and thus is not a new attack
    surface.

2. Typosquatting - user clones from a repository they think they trust but it
isn’t really the right one. Justification:

    ** Existing problem

3. https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/1263[Malicious new
maintainer] of the project creates malicious hooks. Justification:

    ** Similar problem to #1 - maintainer could have instead updated build
    files.

    ** In the case for auto-updating hooks, updated hooks wouldn’t execute until
    the user has issued commands in the repository.

Feature Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minimum Feature Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A central repository can specify a recommended configuration for what hook
commands are enabled for what hook events

    * The suggested configuration should be equivalent to what a user could
    manually install using config-based hooks.

* The configuration specifies where the hook commands reside

    ** This could be a path to a script/binary within the repository

    ** This could be a path to a script/binary contained within submodules of
    the repository

    ** This could be a user installed command or script/binary that exists
    outside of the repository and is present in `$PATH`

* The configuration should only apply if it was received over a secure channel
(HTTPS, SSH)

* The configuration lives outside the worktree.

    ** Allows updated hooks to apply across history and branches, reducing
    the maintenance burden of keeping hooks updated.

    ** Allows different remotes to specify different configuration. This is
    useful for public vs private central repositories or for repositories which
    support different Git functionality.

* The user receives advice to install hooks.

    ** The advice should clearly indicate the suggested hook command(s) and hook
    event(s) as well as the central repository that is suggesting them (via
    remote URL).

    ** The user should be able to use configuration to turn off this advice.

    ** The advice should appear at the following times:

        *** After a clone

        *** After a suggested hook would have run if not already installed. The
        advice should include commands for installing the hook and invoking it.
        For example, for a hook on 'git commit', the user should receive advice
        to amend their commit after hook installation.

* If, after fetch, the central repository suggests new or updated hooks, the
user should receive advice to install these new hooks (note: implementation
should not interfere with requirement listed in“Fast Follows")

* Works across Windows/Linux/macOS

Fast Follows
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Behind configuration, a user can opt to automatically install hook updates
from a given remote.

Nice to Haves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A method to skip hook execution i.e. `--no-verify` works everywhere

* Support a “warnings only mode” where hooks run but don’t block commands from
executing

Out of Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Ensuring the user has installed software that isn't distributed with the repo

Example User Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

==== Example 1: Suggestion to install after clone
....
$ git clone $ORIGIN_URL
...

Remote `origin` ($ORIGIN_URL) suggests the following hooks:
pre-commit: git-secrets --pre_commit_hook
pre-push:  $GIT_ROOT/pre_push.sh

If you wish to install them, run `git hook setup origin`.
To always ignore hooks from `origin`, run `git hook ignore origin`.
....

==== Example 2: Altering when suggested hooks change
....
$ git pull origin

The following hooks were updated from remote `origin` ($ORIGIN_URL):

pre-push:  $GIT_ROOT/pre_push.sh

If you wish to install them, run `git hook setup origin`.
To always ignore hooks from `origin`, run `git hook ignore origin`.
....

==== Example 3: Nudging when hooks weren't installed
....
$ git commit

advice: The repository owner has recommended a 'pre-commit' hook that was not
run: git-secrets --pre_commit_hook.

To install it, run `git hook setup origin pre-commit`. After installation, apply
the hook to your commit by running `git commit --amend`.

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.missingHook to false."
....

==== Example 4: Prompting for automatic hook updates, if opted in via config
....
#~/.gitconfig
[hook]
   allowPromptingAutoUpdateFromRemote = $ORIGIN_URL

$ git pull origin

The following hooks were updated from remote `origin` ($ORIGIN_URL):

pre-push:  $GIT_ROOT/pre_push.sh

If you wish to install them, run `git hook setup origin`.

# If and only if the config is set, following only messages shows and the
# "always" flag works

If you wish to always accept hooks from `origin`, run `git hook setup origin
--always`. You should only do this if you trust code changes from origin.

To always ignore hooks from `origin`, run `git hook ignore origin`.
....

Implementation Exploration: Check special config branch at fetch time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Perform fetch as normal

* After fetch is complete, Git checks for a "magic" config branch (e.g.
+origin/refs/recommended-config+) which contains information about config lines
an end-user may want, including hooks.

* As part of the fetch subcommand, Git alerts users (but not interactively) they
can install install the configs contained there.

Pros
^^^^

* Repository owners have a method for providing recommended config for
contributors.

* Keeping config branch and history separate from code branch and history means
it is versioned, but not tied to user's checkout.

Cons
^^^^

* Requires addition of step to fetch.

* Inflating configs and executables from a remote tracking branch which is never
checked out could be slow.

Future Work
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Extending this to allow repository owners to specify specific configurations
in general e.g. this repository should use partial-clone with these parameters.

* Extending this to support submodules: We want to make sure this works in a way
that's easy to adapt to submodules, who would likely need to run the same hooks
as the superproject; for example, submodules could inherit the superproject
config.

* A way to perform general set up of a code base e.g. installing dependencies,
any first-build related tasks

* Sandboxing hook execution to provide higher levels of security.

Prior Art
~~~~~~~~~

https://github.com/typicode/husky[Husky]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* node.js ecosystem-based solution

* Add it as a dev dependency in package.json

* Supports out-of-the-box configuration: Adding a `prepare` script in
package.json with `husky install` will automate the installation of the husky
script in the .git directory.

https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit[pre-commit]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python-based solution

* Acts as a package manager for linting, installing the required linters as
needed

* `pre-commit install` installs the pre-commit hook shim

* Config is checked into the repository, allowing owners to set versions for
linters

* Provides some out-of-the-box hooks:
https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks[https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks]

Repo Hooks
^^^^^^^^^^

* A Git repository containing hooks commands is specified in the manifest and
checked out during `repo init`.

* A `repo-hooks` element specifies the Git repository where the hooks code lives
and which hook to enable. This is typically
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/repohooks/.

* The only hook event currently supported is `pre-upload`, running when people
run +repo upload+.

* The hooks code file name must be the same as the hook event name e.g.
`pre-upload.py`.

* When a hook is used for the first time, the user is prompted
to approve execution

    ** For manifests fetched via secure protocols (e.g. https://), the user is
    prompted once.

    ** For insecure protocols (e.g. http://), the user is prompted whenever the
    registered repohooks project is updated and a hook is triggered.

* Repo hooks must be python modules (Python 2 or 3, with 2 support deprecated)

* Repo hooks run from the top of the repo directory

    ** if the repo client is under `~/tree/`, then that is where the hook runs,
    even if you ran repo in a git repository at `~/tree/src/foo/`, or in a
    subdirectory of that git repository in `~/tree/src/foo/bar/`.

* `--no-verify` allows developers to bypass hooks.

* `--ignore-hooks` allows developers to run hooks without blocking

* The hooks {repohook-read}[read] a {repohook-config}[config file] to determine
what code to actually execute.

    ** Config can be global e.g. at the top of the Repo workspace and local, and
    they get merged together.

    ** Local config: looks for the closest config file to where you ran repo,
    allowing each repository to configure its own hooks

* Example code that gets run:

    ** pylint3 (requiring this to be installed on the host)

    ** commit_msg_bug_field: require “Bug:” to be present in the commit message
    (built into repohooks)
